win-native.txt contains paths for the qt installation and compilers.
this might not always be necesary but if the meson setup fails (step 1), one of these paths is probably wrong

1: generate build directories

for debug: meson BuildDebug --native-file .\win-native.txt --buildtype debug

for release: meson BuildRelease --native-file .\win-native.txt --buildtype debug

the first argument is just the directory name, can be changed

2: ninja 

ninja -C <build dir>

3: run symupload (still manual for now until we figure out what's happening with it)

cd <builddir> ; ..\Crashpad\Tools\Windows\symbols.bat . fred myQtCrasher 1.0 > ..\Crashpad\Tools\Windows\symbols.out 2>&1
